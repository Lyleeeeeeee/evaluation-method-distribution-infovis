## 📄 About the Paper

In information visualization research, evaluation plays a central role in validating new techniques and understanding user interaction. However, recent trends show an increasing use of multiple evaluations within a single paper, raising questions about sustainability, feasibility, and methodological rigor.

This work conducts a systematic analysis of evaluation method distributions across **214 recent InfoVis papers** (IEEE TVCG 2023–2024) to study:

- How evaluation methods are distributed across different contribution types  
- Trends in over-evaluation and under-evaluation  
- Practical guidance on how evaluation design should match research contributions  

The goal is to provide empirical evidence and methodological guidance for more appropriate and sustainable evaluation practices in visualization research.
